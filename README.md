#task manager

In this project, we’ll be building a Task Manager application using React for the client side and Django Rest Framework for the server side.

React is a powerful JavaScript library, ideal for developing single-page applications (SPA) due to its component-based architecture and exceptional performance. It boasts thorough documentation, which you can explore further if you're interested in delving deeper into React’s capabilities.

In this setup, React will serve as the front end, handling user interface (UI) interactions and communicating with Django's back-end via HTTP requests.

Prerequisites
Before we dive into development, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3 (preferably version 3.5 or higher).
Node.js – You can easily download Node.js from nodejs.org. After installation, confirm it's properly installed by running node --version in your terminal.

Backend First: Django Rest Framework
We’ll begin by setting up the backend using Django Rest Framework, as this channel primarily focuses on server-side programming, especially in Python. Our backend will provide a robust API to manage tasks efficiently, which the React front-end will consume.

## Python scripts

## `python manage.py runserver`
make sure that you have passed python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate

 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
You can see your app running at (https://localhost8000.com/)
